This end-to-end data analysis project focuses on Netflix content data. The process includes data cleaning in Excel, relational modeling in MySQL Workbench, and visualization in Power BI. The goal was to extract insights related to genres, country distribution, ratings, and content availability.

## Project Walkthrough

### 1. Data Cleaning in Excel
- Used Text to Columns, TRIM, IF, SUMIFS, VLOOKUP, LEFT/RIGHT
- Sorted, filtered, and separated datasets into relevant sheets

### 2. Structured Dataset in MySQL
- Imported cleaned dataset to MySQL Workbench
- Created relational tables for robust data connection to Power BI

### 3. Dashboard in Power BI
- Area Chart: Content trends over years
- Bar Chart: Top 10 content categories
- Map: Country-wise Netflix availability
- Single Title Page: Show-level view with filter actions
- Added interactivity with filters, bookmarks, logos, and page navigation

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Microsoft Excel (Data preprocessing)
- MySQL Workbench (Relational database setup)
- Power BI (Visualization & dashboard creation)

## Features

- Data Cleaning in Excel
- Used Excel functions such as Text to Columns, TRIM, IF, SUMIFS, VLOOKUP, LEFT/RIGHT for data transformation
- Imported the cleaned dataset into MySQL Workbench for relational database setup
- Created and visualized interactive dashboards using Power BI

## Key Learnings

- Performed Excel-based preprocessing for real-world datasets
- Applied relational schema design in MySQL
- Built a complete interactive BI dashboard in Power BI
- Improved storytelling using calculated fields, slicers, and branded visuals
